   - Image is uploaded to Cloudinary, URL is saved in the database
3. **View own submissions** and their status (pending/approved/rejected)
4. **View feedback** left by curators on their artworks
5. **Browse public gallery** of approved artworks
6. **Edit profile** (bio, etc.)

### **Curator Workflow**
1. **Register/Login** using email and OTP (role: curator)
2. **Review pending artworks**:
   - Approve or reject submissions
   - Leave feedback for artists

## API Endpoints (Summary)
- `/user/register`, `/user/request-otp`, `/user/verify-otp`, `/user/login`, `/user/profile`
- `/artwork` (POST: submit with image, GET: list), `/artwork/:id`, `/artwork/:id/approve`, `/artwork/:id/reject`, `/artwork/upload` (legacy, now merged into POST /artwork)

**All business logic is modularized (controllers/services/models/middleware).**
- All endpoints are protected by JWT and role-based guards as needed.
- All image uploads are handled via Cloudinary and saved as URLs in the database.
- All actions are logged and errors are handled centrally.

*For more details, see the Swagger UI at `/api/docs` when the backend is running.*
