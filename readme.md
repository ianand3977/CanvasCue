## üóÇÔ∏è Data Models

### User

  passwordHash: string;
  role: 'artist' | 'curator';

}
```

## üîê OTP-Based Authentication Workflow

### Registration
1. User enters details (name, email, bio, role)
2. Backend generates OTP, emails it (Nodemailer/SendGrid)
3. User enters OTP in frontend
4. Backend verifies OTP, creates user, returns success

### Login
1. User enters email
2. Backend generates OTP, emails it
3. User enters OTP
4. Backend verifies OTP, returns JWT/session, redirects to dashboard

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture & Best Practices
- **Modular structure:** Separate frontend (Angular), backend (Node/Express), and database (PostgreSQL)
- **JWT authentication** for secure sessions
- **Winston logging** for robust API monitoring
- **Testing:** Jasmine/Karma (Angular), Jest (Node)
- **Role-based routing and guards**
- **Clean, maintainable code:** Use services, guards, and interceptors in Angular; controllers/services in Node
- **Background jobs** for OTP cleanup
- **Responsive, modern UI/UX**

---

## üöÄ Next Steps
- Scaffold Angular routes and modules for each page
- Build backend endpoints for all models and OTP flows
- Implement role-based guards and JWT handling
- Add tests for all critical flows
